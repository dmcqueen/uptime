# AGENTS Instructions

## Setup for Codex Execution Environment

On each new execution environment, execute the following steps before running any other tasks:

1. Run `npm install` from the repository root to install Node.js dependencies.
2. Install MongoDB so the application and tests have a local database available. For Ubuntu systems this can be accomplished via `apt-get update` followed by `apt-get install -y mongodb`.

These setup steps ensure the repository's Node.js application has the required dependencies and MongoDB server running for testing and development.
